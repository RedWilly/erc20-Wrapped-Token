# erc20-Wrapped-Token
This repository contains the Solidity smart contract for a generic ERC20 token wrapping mechanism. The contract allows users to deposit a specified ERC20 token and receive an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens. These wrapped tokens can later be burned to retrieve the original ERC20 tokens. The contract provides a simple way to create wrapped representations of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Contract Details:
The contract `WrappedToken.sol` implements the logic for wrapping and unwrapping ERC20 tokens. It leverages OpenZeppelin's contracts to ensure security and reliability.

#### Smart Contract Functionality:
- `constructor`: Initializes the contract with an ERC20 token, creating a wrapped representation.
- `deposit`: Allows users to deposit the ERC20 token and receive wrapped tokens.
- `withdraw`: Enables users to burn wrapped tokens and retrieve the original ERC20 tokens.

#### Usage:
Developers can deploy this contract on the Ethereum blockchain to create wrapped versions of ERC20 tokens, allowing token holders to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) or trade on various platforms.

Feel free to modify the description and details to better fit your project and its intended use. This information provides a brief overview for users and developers interested in your contract's.
